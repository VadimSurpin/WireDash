<h2 id="need">What you need</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zigbee2MQTT</strong>, running, with at least one device paired.</li>
  <li><strong>An MQTT broker</strong> that Zigbee2MQTT uses, usually Mosquitto. It can run on Home Assistant, a Raspberry Pi, a server or an SMLIGHT hub. No hub yet? See <a href="../hubs/">the hubs we recommend</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>An Android phone or tablet</strong> on the same Wi-Fi as that hub.</li>
</ul>
<p>No Zigbee2MQTT yet? Open ZigDash and try the demo home first.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="scan">1. Let ZigDash find it</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Connect your phone to your home Wi-Fi. Not a guest network, and turn mobile data off while you set up.</li>
  <li>Open ZigDash and tap <strong>Find my setup</strong>. While it looks, tell it where Zigbee2MQTT runs: Home Assistant, an SMLIGHT hub, a Raspberry Pi or Docker, or not sure.</li>
  <li>ZigDash looks for an MQTT broker on your network, then checks that Zigbee2MQTT is on it.</li>
  <li>Pick the devices you want and you have a dashboard.</li>
</ol>
<div class="tip">If your phone isn't on Wi-Fi, ZigDash says so and gives you a button for the Wi-Fi settings. Once you join, it scans again by itself.</div>

<h2 id="address">2. Nothing found? Connect by address</h2>
<p>The scan can miss a hub behind a second router, on a mesh network, or one that answers slowly. Type its address instead:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find the hub's address: in your router's app, or the address you open Home Assistant or the hub's web page with. It looks like <code>192.168.1.20</code>.</li>
  <li>Type it in ZigDash and tap <strong>Check this address</strong>. You can paste the link from your browser too.</li>
</ol>
<div class="tip">Use the number, not a name. Names ending in <code>.local</code> don't work on every Android phone. Use the address that works at home, not a remote link such as Nabu Casa or DuckDNS.</div>
<p>In manual setup the usual settings are <strong>TCP, port 1883</strong>. Use 8883 only if your broker is set up for TLS. Port 8080 or 80 is the hub's web page, not MQTT.</p>

<h2 id="login">3. The login</h2>
<p>If the broker asks for a login, it wants the <strong>MQTT login</strong>, not the password of your hub's web page.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Home Assistant:</strong> a Home Assistant user. See the <a href="../home-assistant/">Home Assistant guide</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Raspberry Pi or Docker:</strong> the user from Mosquitto's password file. It's the same one in Zigbee2MQTT's <code>configuration.yaml</code> under <code>mqtt</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>SMLIGHT:</strong> the login shown on the hub's web page under Settings › MQTT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zigbee2MQTT already logs in to this broker, so its web page shows the username under Settings › MQTT. Copying a password can add a space at the end; check for one.</p>

<h2 id="hubs">Notes for your hub</h2>
<h3>Home Assistant</h3>
<p>Needs the Mosquitto broker add-on and the Zigbee2MQTT add-on, both running. Full steps in the <a href="../home-assistant/">Home Assistant guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi, Linux or Docker</h3>
<p>Mosquitto 2 only accepts connections from the machine it runs on until you tell it to listen on the network. Add this to <code>mosquitto.conf</code> and restart Mosquitto:</p>
<pre><code>listener 1883
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
allow_anonymous false</code></pre>
<p>Create the user with <code>mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd zigdash</code> (leave out <code>-c</code> if the file already exists).</p>
<h3>SMLIGHT (SMHUB, SLZB)</h3>
<p>Open the hub's web page, go to Settings › MQTT and turn on <strong>Allow External</strong>, so your phone can reach the broker. Check that Zigbee2MQTT shows as running.</p>

<h2 id="away">Away from home</h2>
<p>At home ZigDash talks to your hub directly. To use it away from home, install <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> on the hub and the phone, then add the hub's Tailscale address (<code>100.x.y.z</code>) as the home's remote host. Nothing is opened to the internet and no port forwarding is needed.</p>

<h1>ZigDash with Home Assistant</h1>
<p class="lead">ZigDash shows the devices that Zigbee2MQTT runs. On Home Assistant that means the Mosquitto broker add-on and the Zigbee2MQTT add-on. Your automations stay in Home Assistant and keep running.</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Using ZHA?</strong> ZHA is Home Assistant's own Zigbee and doesn't use MQTT, so ZigDash can't show those devices. ZigDash is for Zigbee2MQTT.</div>

<h2>1. Check the two add-ons</h2>
<p>In Home Assistant, open Settings › Add-ons and check that both are installed and <strong>started</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mosquitto broker</strong>: the MQTT broker.</li>
  <li><strong>Zigbee2MQTT</strong>: with your devices paired. Its configuration should point at the Mosquitto broker (the default on Home Assistant).</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Make a user for ZigDash</h2>
<p>The Mosquitto add-on accepts Home Assistant users. Most people make one just for MQTT:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Settings › People › Users › <strong>Add user</strong>. (Turn on Advanced mode in your profile if you don't see Users.)</li>
  <li>Give it a name like <code>zigdash</code> and a password. It doesn't need to be an administrator.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also use your own Home Assistant login, or a login set in the Mosquitto add-on's options.</p>

<h2>3. Connect ZigDash</h2>
<ol>
  <li>With your phone on your home Wi-Fi, open ZigDash and tap <strong>Find my setup</strong>. When it asks where Zigbee2MQTT runs, choose <strong>Home Assistant</strong>.</li>
  <li>If it doesn't find it, type the address you open Home Assistant with, for example <code>192.168.1.20:8123</code>, and tap <strong>Check this address</strong>. ZigDash finds the broker on the same machine.</li>
  <li>When it asks for a login, enter the user from step 2.</li>
</ol>
<div class="tip"><code>homeassistant.local</code> doesn't work on every Android phone. Use the number address: Home Assistant shows it under Settings › System › Network. Don't use your Nabu Casa or DuckDNS link; ZigDash needs the address that works at home.</div>
<p>The Mosquitto add-on checks each login with Home Assistant, which can take a few seconds on a Raspberry Pi. If ZigDash says the broker didn't answer the login, try again.</p>

<h2>4. Optional: bring your names and rooms</h2>
<p>In ZigDash, Settings › <strong>Import from Home Assistant</strong> reads the names and rooms you gave your devices in Home Assistant, and can make a dashboard for each room. It reads them once and keeps nothing else from Home Assistant.</p>

<h1>Hubs we recommend</h1>

<div class="tip">These are plain links to AliExpress. We don't earn anything from them, and ZigDash works with any Zigbee2MQTT setup, not only these.</div>

<h2 id="smhub-nano">SMHUB Nano: the easy start</h2>
<p><strong>For:</strong> a first Zigbee home, with no computer to look after.</p>
<p>A small box that runs Zigbee2MQTT and the Mosquitto broker on the hub itself. Plug it into your router, pair your devices on its web page, and ZigDash connects to it directly. It also comes with Node-RED for automations and WireGuard for reaching home.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Good:</strong> everything in one box, stored on built-in eMMC rather than an SD card, with an external Zigbee antenna.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> SMLIGHT's hub software is still new and can feel slow in places. Connect it by Ethernet rather than Wi-Fi.</li>
  <li><strong>In ZigDash:</strong> turn on <strong>Allow External</strong> in the hub's Settings › MQTT, then tap Find my setup and choose SMLIGHT.</li>

<h2 id="smhub">SMHUB Essentials and Premium: room to grow</h2>
<p><strong>For:</strong> bigger homes, or if you may add Z-Wave later.</p>
<p>The same idea as the Nano, with two radios instead of one and slots for add-on modules (Z-Wave, PoE, LTE). Premium has the newer, stronger radios. Zigbee2MQTT and Mosquitto run on the hub, just like the Nano.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Good:</strong> a second radio for Thread, and the most room to expand.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> more than most homes need, and the add-on modules cost extra.</li>

<p><strong>For:</strong> people who already run Zigbee2MQTT on a Pi, a server or Home Assistant, and want a better Zigbee radio.</p>
<p>A network Zigbee coordinator: it plugs into your router (with PoE, one cable does power and network) and Zigbee2MQTT connects to it over the network, so it can sit in the middle of the house instead of behind a computer. SMLIGHT recommends the TI versions (SLZB-06 and SLZB-06P7) for Zigbee2MQTT.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Good:</strong> solid, widely used, and easy to place where the signal is best.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> it is only the Zigbee radio. Zigbee2MQTT and the broker still run on your own Pi or server, so on its own it is not a complete setup.</li>
